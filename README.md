cd dashboard
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/school_db

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-secret-key

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. **Set up the database**
```bash
# Generate migrations
npm run db:generate

# Push schema to database
npm run db:push
```

5. **Start development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Development Commands

### Core Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build production application
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

### Database Operations
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate database migrations from schema changes
- `npm run db:push` - Push schema changes to database
- `npm run db:drop` - Drop database tables (destructive)
- `npm run db:check` - Validate database schema consistency

## Architecture

### Backend Architecture

**4-Layer Pattern:**
```
Controller → Service → Repository → Validator
```

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests/responses
- **Services**: Business logic implementation
- **Repositories**: Database operations (Drizzle ORM)
- **Validators**: Input validation and business rules

### Frontend Architecture

**Feature-Based Structure:**
- Each feature module contains components, hooks, and configurations
- Shared component library with N-prefix naming convention
- Consistent patterns across all entities using `useEntityCRUD` hook

## Key Features Explained

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent)
- Secure session management
- Password encryption

### Data Tables (NTable)
- Advanced sorting and filtering
- Column visibility controls
- Responsive design with automatic card/table toggle
- Bulk operations support
- Mobile-first approach

### Form System (NForm)
- React Hook Form integration
- Zod validation schemas
- Automatic error handling
- Toast notifications
- TypeScript type safety

### State Management
- **Server State**: React Query for API data caching
- **Global State**: Zustand for UI and auth state
- **Form State**: React Hook Form for form handling

## User Roles

1. **Admin**: Full system access, user management, system configuration
2. **Teacher**: Class management, grading, attendance tracking
3. **Student**: View grades, attendance, assignments, announcements
4. **Parent**: Monitor children's academic progress and attendance

## Default Credentials

After initial setup, use these credentials to log in:
- **Admin**: (will be created during seed process)

## Database Schema

### Core Entities
- Users (Admin, Teachers, Students, Parents)
- Classes and Sections
- Subjects and Assessments
- Attendance Records
- Grades and Evaluations
- Fee Types and Payments
- Vehicles and Drivers
- Announcements and Events
- Files and Documents

### Key Relationships
- Students belong to Classes
- Classes have Teachers and Subjects
- Parents are linked to Students
- Attendance tracked per Class
- Grades linked to Assessments

## API Documentation

API endpoints follow RESTful conventions:

```
GET    /api/students          # Get all students
GET    /api/students/:id      # Get student by ID
POST   /api/students          # Create student
PUT    /api/students/:id      # Update student
DELETE /api/students/:id      # Delete student
```

Similar patterns apply to all entities (teachers, classes, fees, etc.)

## Internationalization

Supported languages:
- English (en)
- French (fr)
- Arabic (ar)

- Image optimization
- Code splitting and bundle optimization
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Mobile performance considerations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database connection errors:**
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check DATABASE_URL in .env file
- Ensure database exists

**Build errors:**
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
